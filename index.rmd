```{r}
rtxt <- robotstxt::robotstxt("https://www.imdb.com/")
rtxt$check(paths = c("/","api/"), bot = "*")
```
Read all the HTML from that page into an object in R. (this is reading in the html version of the website you are looking at)

```{r}
ratings <- read_html("https://www.imdb.com/chart/tvmeter?ref_=nv_tvv_mptv")
```

Find nodes (nodes always start with a . in front). If there is a td means that the information is in a table column and tr means that it is table row.

```{r}
temporary <- ratings %>% html_nodes(css="table") %>% html_table(header = TRUE)
```

```{r}
rating_table <- temporary[[1]]
```
